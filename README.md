## Installing

In order to run the sample, you need the following:

A Web Server that supports PHP (example: Heroku)
A public URL for your game
Your favorite browser

For speed and convenience, it might be worthwhile running a local webserver as you develop. Plenty of solutions exist on the web to help you get started, most of which are free and open source. Check out XAMPP as a starting point.
